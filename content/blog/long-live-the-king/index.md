### We have a champion

Congratulations to our global champion Ryan Arnot for taking it all.

Ryan has defeated over 10,000 others to claim victory. From this day until his last day, may he be remembered for his glorious victory by all those who fought and all of his future employers reading this blog post.

*Long live the king.*
